TODO

=head1 TRUNK

=head2 Request Writer

Cleanup much like RequestBuilder, many small things to do here

=head2 Standalone

L<Parallel::Prefork> ?

=head2 FCGI

FCGI::Request can build the _connection structure directly, and use the normal RequestBuilder

pass params to handle_request explicitly a la Standalone

=head2 ModPerl

HTTP::Engine::Interface::Apache::RequestBuilder should delegate everything to
$request->_connection->{apache_request}. Should be very simple and efficient

=head2 POE

Like Standalone

=head2 Test

Use the Dummy request builder instead of HTTP::Request::AsCGI

=head1 NO CONTEXT BRANCH
